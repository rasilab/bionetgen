- Optionally designate molecule siteas as polymer sites for efficient simulation of mRNA translation. This is done by following the state definition by =:POLYMER=polymer_typeinteger-polymer_location-polymer_interaction_distance)
  - POLYMER is a required keyword
  - If POLYMER is given then, three arguments are required: polymer_type, polymer_location, polymer_interaction_distance are all non-negative integers separated by hyphen.
